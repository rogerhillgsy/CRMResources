<DIV style="FONT-SIZE: 13px"><B>User Notes.</B> This template is both a checklist to help prepare suitable proposals and a record of the review that occurs near the end of the bid process, before the proposal is issued. As part of the bid process, an assessment of commercial risk should be made. For each of the risk factors in the table on the right, judge risk to be low, medium or high and indicate this on the right of the table. For any aspect judged to be medium or high risk the relevant section of this review record should be completed and discussed with the bid reviewers. For low risk areas, completion of the relevant section is optional.</DIV></TD>
